# Backend Development Guidelines - Voice AI Ordering

## Voice AI Integration Architecture

### AI Service Stack
- OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text conversion
- GPT-4 for conversational order processing
- OpenAI TTS for natural voice response generation
- Conversation context management and persistence

### API Endpoints Structure
- `/api/voice/session` - Start/manage voice ordering sessions
- `/api/voice/process` - Process voice input and generate responses
- `/api/voice/orders` - Handle voice order creation and management
- `/api/voice/payments` - Voice-controlled payment processing

### Voice Order Processing Flow
1. Initialize voice session with customer context
2. Process speech-to-text input via Whisper
3. Send conversation to GPT-4 with menu context
4. Generate appropriate response and order actions
5. Convert response to speech via TTS
6. Update order state and conversation history
7. Handle payment confirmation and order submission

## Integration Requirements

### Menu Knowledge Integration
- Load menu items, prices, and descriptions into AI context
- Handle menu item recommendations and suggestions
- Process customization requests through conversation
- Validate menu item availability and pricing

### Order Management Integration
- Connect with existing Order entity and OrderService
- Build orders incrementally through conversation
- Validate order items and customizations
- Calculate totals and tax through voice interaction

### Payment Processing Integration
- Extend existing payment services for voice confirmation
- Handle saved payment method selection through voice
- Process Apple Pay/Google Pay confirmations via voice
- Integrate with existing Stripe payment flow

### Conversation Management
- Maintain conversation context across multiple exchanges
- Handle order modifications and corrections
- Manage conversation timeouts and session cleanup
- Store conversation history for customer service

## Technical Implementation

### OpenAI Integration Configuration
- Secure API key management
- Request rate limiting and error handling
- Audio file processing and cleanup
- Response streaming for real-time experience

### WebSocket Communication
- Real-time bidirectional communication with frontend
- Voice session state synchronization
- Connection management and cleanup
- Error recovery and reconnection handling

### Database Extensions
- Voice session tracking and persistence
- Conversation history storage
- Voice order metadata and analytics
- Customer voice preferences and settings

## Performance and Scalability
- Optimize AI API call efficiency
